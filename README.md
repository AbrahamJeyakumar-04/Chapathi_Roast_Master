# Chapathi Roast Master üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Team Aura


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Abraham Jeyakumar - NSS College of Engineering
- Member 2: Aravind Sunil - NSS College of Engineering

### Project Description
Chapathi Roast Master is a fun AI-powered web app that analyzes the roundness of your chapathi and delivers brutally honest, South Indian‚Äìstyle roast feedback. Just upload a photo, and it scores your chapathi while serving spicy remarks to help you roll it better¬†next¬†time.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Humanity faces a crisis no one dares to talk about‚Äîtragically misshapen chapathis. Every day, millions of dinner plates are disgraced by ovals, blobs, and ‚Äúwhat even is this shape?‚Äù disasters. Aunties are whispering, mother-in-laws are judging, and Instagram likes are plummeting. It‚Äôs time to restore dignity to the humble¬†chapathi.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built Chapathi Roast Master, the AI overlord your kitchen never knew it needed. Just snap a pic of your chapathi, and our algorithm will measure its roundness with surgical precision, then roast you harder than your tawa ever could. It‚Äôs part shape detector, part stand-up comedian, and 100% committed to making your chapathis (and ego) perfectly¬†round.
